# Warframe-Index-Macro

***Only tested on arch linux***
***This script was made to run on i3 mainly with picom disabled***

Just my bash script for doing index with excalibur umbra AFK
the script requires xdotool to work properly

I'm using excalibur umbra with kohm (though phantasma also works)
no other weapons equipped and zenurik

Please go to the script and replace the WarframeWindowId
you can get the WarframeWindowId with --> sleep 10; xdotool getactivewindow
